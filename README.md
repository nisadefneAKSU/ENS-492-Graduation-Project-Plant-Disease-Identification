# ENS-492-Graduation-Project-Plant-Disease-Identification
The “New Plant Diseases Dataset” containing distinct healthy and unhealthy crop leaves will be used. This project’s main aims are to plan and design an advanced app that gives accurate classification and identification of plants, to diagnose the plant if it has a disease and to provide the user with information about the disease.
